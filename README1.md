#BLOCKCHAIN
The blockchain technology is currently at the _peak of inflated expectations_ and is expected to be ready for mainstream adoption in 5 to 10 years.
Various benefits of this technology are being envisaged such as decentralized trust, cost savings, transparency, and efficiency.
To understand the blockchain technology we have to focus on the distributed systems first because it is his roots.

##Distributed systems

Distributed systems are a computing paradigm whereby two or more nodes work with each other in a coordinated fashion in order to achieve a common outcome and it's modeled in sucha a way that end users see it as a single logical platform.
A *node* can be defined as an individual player in a distributed system. All nodes are capable of sending and receiving messages to and from each other. Nodes can be honest, faulty, or malicious and have their own memory and processor. A node that can exhibit arbitrary behavior is also know as a _Byzantine node_. This arbitrary behavior can be intentionally malicious, which is detrimental to the operation of the network. Generally, *any unexpected behavior of a node on the network can be categorized as Byzantine*. This term arbitrarily encompasses any behavior that is unexpected or malicious.
